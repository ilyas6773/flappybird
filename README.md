> A mobile game by Dong Nguyen that went viral in 2013, utilizing a very simple but effective gameplay mechanic of avoiding pipes indefinitely by just tapping the screen, making the player's bird avatar flap its wings and move upwards slightly. A variant of popular games like "Helicopter Game" that floated around the internet for years prior. Illustrates some of the most basic procedural generation of game levels possible as by having pipes stick out of the ground by varying amounts, acting as an infinitely generated obstacle course for the player.
